# Book of Apps for Statistics Teaching

The apps in this collection are the work of undergraduate students majoring in Statistics at Penn State University. These students took part in the **_BOAST_** (Book of Apps for Statistics Teaching) program in 2017-2022. The program included either a DataCamp course on Shiny (2018, 2019) or a full day [workshop](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots17/workshop/5) at the U.S. Conference On Teaching Statistics on Developing R Shiny Applications to Enhance Teaching and Learning presented by Justin Post and Herle McGowan from North Carolina State University (2017). This was followed by a full-time summer research experience developing the apps in this collection throughout the months of June and July. Finally, the **_BOAST_** students take part in a one-credit research class in Fall semester to showcase their work to statistics instructors, prepare a survey and IRB application to get student feedback in a human subjects research setting, and then formally test their apps in a live class. Besides gaining expertise in R and R Shiny, the students gained a deeper understanding of selected statistical concepts and learned crucial skills in the team-based reproducible development of software (e.g. though the use of the GitHub platform). This book is laid out in thirteen chapters with four at the introductory level covering topics in **Data Gathering**, **Data Description**, **Basic Probability**, and **Statistical Inference**, eight chapters at the upper division level covering **Probability**, **Regression**, **ANOVA**, **Time Series**, **Sampling**, **Categorical Data**, **Data Science**, and **Stochastic Processes**, and one chapter devoted to statistical topics in Biology.

## Usage
The apps contained within this project are designed to be used as standalone activities or in conjunction with a lesson. Depending on your needs, you may want to clone the book as a whole or just a select chapter or app. The [BOAST](https://github.com/EducationShinyAppTeam/BOAST) repository is a place for linking the individual projects within each chapter. As apps get updated, releases will trickle up to this level.

Apps can be run locally on your computer, self-hosted on a [Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/) or [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/), or through managed hosting solutions like [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). **Note:** There may be a cost associated with larger numbers of concurrent users.

### RStudio Connect
As of RStudio Connect v1.7.6, apps can be [deployed via Git Repository](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/06/24/rstudio-connect-1-7-6/). This allows apps to self-update any time a commit is pushed to the tracked branch. Each app contains a `manifest.json` file to pull in the required dependencies. See [Git Backed Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed.html) for more information.

## Downloading
This book is separated by chapter into submodules, to download the entire book use the command:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EducationShinyAppTeam/BOAST
